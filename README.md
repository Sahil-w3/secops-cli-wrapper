## 🎯 What is SecOps CLI Wrapper?

SecOps CLI Wrapper is a beginner-friendly command-line tool that makes cybersecurity automation both **powerful** and **educational**. Unlike traditional security tools that just give you results, our tool teaches you *why* each step matters while performing real security assessments.

### ✨ Key Features

- **🧠 Smart Tool Selection**: Automatically chooses the right security tools based on your target (IP, domain, file, etc.)
- **🔄 Intelligent Workflows**: Chains security tools in logical sequences (port scan → web scan → analysis)
- **📚 Learning Mode**: Explains every action with educational context - perfect for students and beginners
- **🎨 Beautiful Output**: Clean, colorful results using Rich library
- **⚡ Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS
- **🔧 Extensible**: Easy to add new security tools and learning modules

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/secops-cli-wrapper.git
cd secops-cli-wrapper

# Set up virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install security tools (Ubuntu/Debian example)
sudo apt install nmap nikto clamav
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Scan a website with learning explanations
python main.py scan example.com --learn

# Quick port scan
python main.py scan 192.168.1.1

# Check which security tools are available
python main.py config --list-tools

# Interactive learning mode
python main.py learn
```

## 🎓 Why SecOps CLI Wrapper?

### Traditional Security Tools vs. SecOps CLI Wrapper

| Traditional Tools | SecOps CLI Wrapper |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| ❌ Complex syntax for beginners | ✅ Simple, intuitive commands |
| ❌ No explanation of results | ✅ Explains what each finding means |
| ❌ Manual tool selection | ✅ Automatically picks the right tools |
| ❌ Scattered results | ✅ Unified, correlated analysis |
| ❌ Steep learning curve | ✅ Learn cybersecurity while doing it |

### Perfect For:

- **🎓 Students** learning cybersecurity fundamentals
- **👨‍💻 Beginners** who want to understand security testing
- **🏢 Small teams** needing automated security assessments
- **📖 Self-learners** exploring penetration testing concepts
